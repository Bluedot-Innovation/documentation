Configure Now Ready
===================

Now Ready UI can be configured to match the branding of the Brand we are working with.

You need to provide us with the logo and the color of the buttons to be displayed in the Now Ready UI.

We support logos in the following formats: png, jpg or jpeg. For best results, logos should either fill the entire image or have a transparent/white background.

You are also able to choose the fields that are displayed in the “Help us find you faster!” form.

Depending on your use case you can select if you want to have the “I’m On My Way” and “I’m Here” screens or just the “I’m Here” screen.
