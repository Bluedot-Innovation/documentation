# Overview

With the **Point SDK** already providing powerful location-based engagement, we’re extending its capabilities to include **Rezolve AI**. This new integration focuses on commerce-related interactions—like product inquiries, order updates, and on-the-go shopping assistance—by delivering real-time, streaming responses right inside your iOS or Android app.

### Key Highlights

- **Commerce Intelligence**: Tailored responses for product discovery, sales enablement, and customer support.
- **Seamless Chat Sessions**: Easily create, manage, and close chat sessions, preserving conversation context across multiple interactions.
- **Streaming Responses**: Deliver partial responses as they are generated, helping users get answers faster and stay engaged.
- **Platform Support**: Compatible with iOS 15+ and Android (API level 26+), building on top of your existing Point SDK setup.

By combining location intelligence from the Point SDK with commerce-focused natural language understanding, you can offer a richer, more personalised user experience—right where and when your customers need it most.
