Overview
=======================

The following methods are available to your app to utilise the low-energy, high accuracy Point SDK.  These methods are provided in the `bluedotPointSDKCDVPlugin.js` file and provide cross-platform access to iOS and Android.

*   [Quick Start](./Quick%20Start.md)
*   [Geo-triggering](./Geo-triggering.md)
*   [Tempo](./Tempo.md)
*   [Features](./Features.md)
*   [Events List](./Events%20List.md)

The iOS and Android plug-in source code provides everything required to compile and build your Cordova or PhoneGap app, including the Point SDK library files for each platform; you will need to [request a trial account](https://bluedot.io/contact-us/) to be able to gain access to the platform and create Geofences, Geolines™ and place beacons for your app to trigger.  For more information refer to our [Canvas dashboard documentation](../../Canvas/Overview.md).

The functions in the plug-in encapsulate cross-platform functionality.  Should more in-depth integration with the Point SDK be required, then please refer to the [iOS SDK](../../Point%20SDK/iOS/Overview.md) and [Android SDK](../../Point%20SDK/Android/Overview.md) documentation.
