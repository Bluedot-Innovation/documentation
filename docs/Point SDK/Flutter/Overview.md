Overview
=================================

Flutter Bluedot Point SDK is a wrapper around the [Android Point SDK](https://docs.bluedot.io/android-sdk/) and [iOS Point SDK](https://docs.bluedot.io/ios-sdk/), allowing for Bluedot integration in Flutter apps. Functionality is provided through one single flutter plugin so you can use it for both platforms without downloading any extra packages.

The following pages provide a guide to integrating the Point SDK with your Flutter app.
