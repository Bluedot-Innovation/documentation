Overview
========

Welcome to Rezolve's Point SDK documentation! Our SDK integrates with both native and cross-platform frameworks, empowering your app with precise, efficient location services.

## What is Point SDK?

Point SDK is Rezolve's mobile location intelligence engine that brings high-accuracy geofencing and ETA prediction capabilities to your iOS and Android applications. With minimal battery impact and offline capability, Point SDK enables you to create sophisticated location-based experiences.

## Key Capabilities

### Geo-triggering
Trigger actions when users enter or exit geofenced areas with 20x more accuracy than standard geofencing solutions. Perfect for:
- Store arrival notifications
- Proximity marketing campaigns
- Location-based content delivery
- Customer journey tracking

### Tempo (ETA Predictions)
Get real-time customer arrival estimates as they travel to your locations. Ideal for:
- Curbside pickup optimization
- Drive-thru order timing
- Delivery coordination
- Staff preparation alerts

### Low Battery Impact
Advanced algorithms ensure minimal battery drain while maintaining precision location tracking, even when your app is in the background.

### Offline Capability
Geofences work even without network connectivity - triggers fire locally on the device.
