Overview
========

Welcome to Rezolve's Point SDK documentation! Our SDK integrates with both native and cross-platform frameworks, empowering your app with precise, efficient location services.

## What is Point SDK?

Point SDK is Rezolve's mobile location intelligence engine that brings high-accuracy geofencing and ETA prediction capabilities to your iOS and Android applications. With minimal battery impact and offline capability, Point SDK enables you to create sophisticated location-based experiences.

## Key Capabilities

### Geo-triggering
Trigger actions when users enter or exit geofenced areas with 20x more accuracy than standard geofencing solutions. Perfect for:
- Store arrival notifications
- Proximity marketing campaigns
- Location-based content delivery
- Customer journey tracking

### Tempo (ETA Predictions)
Get real-time customer arrival estimates as they travel to your locations. Ideal for:
- Curbside pickup optimization
- Drive-thru order timing
- Delivery coordination
- Staff preparation alerts

### Low Battery Impact
Advanced algorithms ensure minimal battery drain while maintaining precision location tracking, even when your app is in the background.

### Offline Capability
Geofences work even without network connectivity - triggers fire locally on the device.

## Choose Your Platform

The Point SDK is available for all major mobile development platforms. Select your platform below to get started:

**Native Platforms** - Best performance and full feature access
- **Android**: For native Android apps (Java/Kotlin)
- **iOS**: For native iOS apps (Swift/Objective-C)

**Cross-Platform Frameworks** - Single codebase for multiple platforms
- **React Native**: Wrapper around native SDKs for React Native apps
- **Flutter**: Plugin for Flutter applications
- **Cordova**: Plugin for hybrid apps using web technologies
- **Xamarin**: Bindings for .NET-based development

### Not Sure Which Platform?
- **Building a new app?** Choose native (Android/iOS) for best performance and full API access
- **Have existing React Native/Flutter app?** Use our wrapper plugins for easy integration
- **Need web support?** Check out our [Web SDK](../Web%20SDK/Overview) instead
- **No mobile app at all?** Consider [Wave API](../APIs/Wave%20API/Overview) for web-based solutions
