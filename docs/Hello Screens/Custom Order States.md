Custom Order States
===================

The Custom Order States feature in Hello Screens allows brands to add order states that align more accurately with their store operations flow. This ensures that the order tracking process is more tailored to each brandâ€™s specific needs, leading to more efficient operations and enhanced customer satisfaction.

### Default Order States
By default, Hello Screens includes the following order states:

* **On The Way:** The customer is en route to collect their order. This state also provides the estimated time of arrival (ETA) when tracked with [Tempo](../Tempo/Overview.md).
* **Arrived:** The customer has arrived at the store detected by our [Point SDK](../Point%20SDK/Overview.mdx).
* **Complete:** The order has been successfully handed over to the customer and marked complete.

### Example of Custom Order States for a Restaurant
To illustrate how custom order states can be used, consider the following example of a restaurant's order flow:

* **Ready to Prepare:** The order has been received and is ready to be prepared.
* **On The Way:** The customer is on their way to collect their order.
* **Arrived:** The customer has arrived at the store.
* **At Pickup Window:** The customer is at the designated pickup window.
* **Complete:** The order has been successfully handed over to the customer and marked complete.
