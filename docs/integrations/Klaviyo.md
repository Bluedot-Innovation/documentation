**Klaviyo API Rate Limits**
To ensure seamless event transmission from Bluedot to Klaviyo, it's crucial to understand Klaviyo's API rate limits that apply to your account. These limits affect how many events you can send within a given timeframe. We strongly advise familiarizing yourself with these limits to guarantee that all your Bluedot-triggered events are successfully received by Klaviyo without interruption.
