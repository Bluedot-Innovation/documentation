DoorDash Integration
====================

The DoorDash integration with Hello Screens enhances your store's ability to manage deliveries effectively by providing real-time updates on dasher ETAs and arrival statuses. This integration ensures that your order management process is seamless, with continuous updates that help store staff prepare orders just in time for pickup, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

### Event Handling in Hello Screens:

- `DASHER_CONFIRMED`: When this event is received, the order is registered in Hello Screens, ensuring that the store is aware of the upcoming delivery from the start. This marks the beginning of the order tracking process in the system.

- `dasher_enroute_to_pickup`: As this event is received every 30 seconds, Hello Screens updates the order ticket with the dasherâ€™s latest ETA. This allows the store staff to precisely time the preparation of the order, reducing the chance of delays and ensuring that the order is ready when the dasher arrives.

- `DASHER_CONFIRMED_PICKUP_ARRIVAL`: Once this event is received, the order ticket in Hello Screens is updated to "Arrived." This status change immediately notifies staff that the dasher is at the pickup location, prompting them to hand off the order without delay.
