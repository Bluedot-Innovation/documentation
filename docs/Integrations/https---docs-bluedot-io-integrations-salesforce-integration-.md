Salesforce Marketing Cloud Integration
======================================

You can use the [Bluedot Location Marketing app](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000Dq8lCEAR) from the Salesforce AppExchange to power personalized customer journeys at scale. With Salesforce + Bluedot together you can send Push messages when the customer arrives at your restaurant, trigger specific email campaigns based on visits to a rival’s store, or create an immersive game experience, engaging your customers as they move throughout real-world locations.

Before your start
-----------------

**1\. Have access to your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account**  
You must have a Salesforce Marketing Cloud account that you currently use to manage all your marketing campaigns and personalized customer journeys. If your enterprise doesn’t already have a Salesforce Marketing Cloud account, you’ll need to speak with your Salesforce Account Executive.

**2\. Get access to Bluedot**  
You’ll need an active Bluedot account to use your Bluedot + Salesforce integration. [Contact our team](https://bluedot.io/demo/) here if you need to set up your account.

**3\. Integrate Bluedot into your mobile app**  
Before you can use this integration, the Bluedot Point SDK must be integrated into your iOS and/or Android app. You can learn more about SDK integration, specifically for SFMC here.
