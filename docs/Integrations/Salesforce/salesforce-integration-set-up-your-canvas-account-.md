Set up your Canvas account
==========================

Once you have linked Canvas to your SFMC account, you will need to [create a Project](https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/creating-a-new-project/) and [add your first Zones](https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/add-a-new-zone/) and geofences.

You can find more information on using Canvas and configuring geofences [here](https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/).
