======================

Create a Project is your first step. All your Zones and all geofences exist with a Project.

1\. From the **Project** dropdown, select the **Add new project** button

2\. Give the Project a name and the **Create** button

3\. And that’s it!

You will be redirected to the **Dashboard** where you can start adding **Zones** to your project.

But default, the **Rule Download Interval** for your new **Project** all be 24-hours. However, these can easily be changed from the Project configuration.

Once you’ve created a **Project**, you’re ready to start adding **Zones.** Check this article on [how to create a Zone.](../Canvas/Add%20a%20new%20zone.md)
