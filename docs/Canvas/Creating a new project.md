2\. Give the Project a name and the **Create** button

3\. And that’s it!

You will be redirected to the **Dashboard** where you can start adding **Zones** to your project.

But default, the **Rule Download Interval** for your new **Project** all be 24-hours. However, these can easily be changed ([Learn more here.](https://bluedotinnovation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001249775))

Once you’ve created a **Project**, you’re ready to start adding **Zones.** Check this article on [how to create a Zone.](https://docs.bluedot.io/canvas/add-a-new-zone/)
