Adding a Zone
=============

You’ll need to create a **Zone** before you can start adding in specific **Geofences**. Each Zone can have one or many **Geofences** – that’s up to you and your use case.

1\. Head to the Dashboard screen

2\. Check you’re using the right Project (the Project dropdown is at the top of the screen)

3\. Click the _\+ Add Zone_ button

4\. Give your Zone a name

5\. Search for the address or point of interest (POI) where you’d like to create the geo-fence

7\. Click Create

At any time you head back into a Zone to:

*   Add a new, additional geofence to the Zone
*   Tag the Zone
*   Rename the Zone
*   Edit the size of the geofence

You can also create Zones programmatically using our Config API. [Learn more about Config API](https://docs.bluedot.io/config-api/).
