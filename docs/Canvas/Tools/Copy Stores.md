Do not close the browser tab or navigate away from the Canvas page while the copying process is in progress. Doing so may interrupt the operation and result in incomplete Store transfers.

### Caveats and Limitations
* **Maximum Stores:** You can copy up to 500 Stores in one action. For larger transfers, multiple actions may be necessary.

* **Project Settings:** The Copy Stores tool only duplicates Store configurations. Other project-specific settings, integrations, and webhook setups are not affected.
