# Historical Event Tracking

### Overview

Our analytics platform's "Historical" feature enables users to track and visualise the number of events generated by Rezolve products over time. This tool lets you segment the visualised data by specific event types, such as Geo-triggering, Tempo, Wave API and Hello.

### Accessing Historical Analytics

- **Step 1:** Select the "Analytics" tab from the Navigation bar.
- **Step 2:** Click on "Historical" from the dropdown menu.

### Selecting Event Types for Visualisation

Within the Historical feature, users can filter the data to visualise the following event types:

- **Geo-triggering:** Tracks daily "Entry" events generated by the Mobile SDK.
- **Tempo:** Displays daily updates generated by our Mobile SDK, reflecting users' location updates.
- **Wave API:** Shows the daily count of Wave API events, indicating API usage levels.
- **Hello Screens:** Provides data on the daily events generated by the Hello Screens.
