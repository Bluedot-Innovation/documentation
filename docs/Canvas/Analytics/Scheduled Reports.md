Scheduled Reports
=============

The Schedule Reports feature lets you generate, schedule, and manage detailed reports for the Hello stack (order management) and geofencing data (location-based events) directly from the Canvas.

### Report Types
#### Hello Stack Reports (Order Management)
Focus on click-and-collect order management, useful for monitoring order statuses, managing pick-up times, and analyzing trends.

#### Geofencing Data Reports (Location-Based events)
Utilize geofencing data to analyze customer movements, measure marketing campaign effectiveness, gamefication and optimize promotions.


With the Scheduled Reports, you can:
* **Generate Reports:** Create reports with a consistent column structure tailored to your needs, ensuring uniformity and ease of analysis.
* Schedule Report Distribution: Set up daily, weekly, or monthly schedules for automatic report generation and email distribution tailored to your time zone.
* **Manage Email Distribution Lists:** Specify a list of email addresses, including internal team members and external stakeholders, to automatically receive the reports.
* **Admin-Only Access:** Ensure secure and controlled access to the report generation and scheduling functionalities, limited to users with Admin permissions.
* **CSV Format Reports:** Receive reports in CSV format, facilitating easy data analysis and sharing.
This Hello Report gives you more control over your data, provides immediate access to essential information, and enhances operational efficiency.
